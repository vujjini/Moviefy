#### Description:
Hello world, My name is Sriram and I am from India. The web app I created for the final project of this amazing course is called Moviefy.
As the name sugests it recommends a random movie based on a movie or movies that the user inputs. Here's how it works,

1. Click on the 'Moviefy' button at the home page

2. You are gonna be redirected to a page where you would need to input either one or two movies
depending upon the variety of recommendations you want.

3. After you submit the titles, you get the recommendation. If you don't like the recommendation or you've already watched it
click on the 'want another one' button to get another one.
So those are the features of Moviefy.

In applications.py I have used a movie database called TMDb which gives access to a free API.
Then, I have used TMDb's own library called 'tmdb3api' in order to use some really helpful functions for looking up movies and
getting details of those movies. I had to use multiple 'if' statements to ensure the user doesn't run into errors that I, the programmer,
do.

I have created another python application called helpers.py to use only one function called 'apology' which was inspired from the problem set 9
called 'finance'. I have used it for minimal but big errors the user may run into if he/she submitted the name of a movie that is non-existent
or is the name of a TV show (this web app is movie based).

The templates folder contains generate.html -the page where the recommended movie and its poster show up-, index.html -which is the home page-
, input.html -which contains the form where the user inputs his/her favourite movie-, and layout.html -which contains the whole layout of the page
and acts a placeholder for all the other .html pages by using some jinja syntax.

The static folder contains the stylesheet for the web app.

As for the design changes I've used, I didn't put much of a thought into naming the variables, as I have first
thought that naming wasn't gonna have much significance. It was not until I started
using multiple 'if' statements, when irrespondibly naming varialbles backfired on me. It was a great lesson that I have learnt ,i.e, never EVER take naming the varibles
for granted.



Primarily I wanted to route to the netlfix or amazon's or any other streaming service URL wherever the recommended movie is available,
but later I realized that I couldn't, as Netflix and amazon prime video stopped allowing developers from accessing their public APIs.
